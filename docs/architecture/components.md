# Component Architecture

This document outlines the CIPP frontend component architecture, design principles, and architectural patterns. For detailed component documentation, API references, and implementation examples, see the [component library documentation](../components/README.md).

## Architectural Overview

The CIPP component library follows a modular, composable architecture designed for scalability, reusability, and maintainability in multi-tenant Microsoft 365 management scenarios.

### Design Principles

1. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Components are designed to be composed together rather than extended
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a focused, well-defined purpose
3. **Tenant-Aware**: All components handle multi-tenant context automatically
4. **Permission-Controlled**: Role-based access control is built into component logic
5. **API-First**: Components integrate seamlessly with the CIPP API layer
6. **Material-UI Consistency**: All components follow Material-UI v6+ patterns and theming

## Component Categories

### 1. [CippCards](../components/cipp-cards/README.md) - Information Display
**Purpose**: Dashboard and information display components for presenting metrics, status, and interactive content.

**Key Patterns**:
- **Metric Display**: Single-value cards with optional actions and visual indicators
- **Property Lists**: Key-value displays with conditional rendering and copy functionality  
- **Data Visualization**: Chart integration with Material-UI theming and responsive design
- **Interactive Cards**: Action-enabled cards for navigation and operations

### 2. [CippTable](../components/cipp-table/README.md) - Data Management
**Purpose**: Comprehensive data table system for large dataset management with advanced features.

**Key Patterns**:
- **List Management**: Read-only data display with export and filtering capabilities
- **Interactive Management**: Tables with row actions, bulk operations, and detail panels
- **Report Generation**: Data analysis interfaces with advanced filtering and simple column modes
- **Selection Interfaces**: Multi-select functionality for bulk operations

### 3. [CippFormPages](../components/cipp-forms/README.md) - Form Management
**Purpose**: Standardized form components with validation, error handling, and submission workflows.

**Key Patterns**:
- **Form Lifecycle Management**: Complete form pages with validation, submission, and error handling
- **Universal Field Components**: Type-safe field components that integrate with React Hook Form
- **Tenant-Aware Selectors**: Specialized selectors for multi-tenant operations
- **Section Organization**: Collapsible form sections for complex data entry workflows

### 4. [CippWizard](../components/cipp-wizard/README.md) - Multi-Step Workflows
**Purpose**: Components for complex multi-step processes with validation and progress tracking.

**Key Patterns**:
- **Step Management**: Progressive workflow with validation checkpoints
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic step visibility based on user input
- **State Persistence**: Form data maintained across step navigation
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators and completion status

### 5. [CippComponents](../components/cipp-components/README.md) - Utility Components
**Purpose**: General-purpose components providing common functionality across the application.

**Key Patterns**:
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Dialog management, tenant context, API integration utilities
- **Layout Helpers**: Page templates, off-canvas panels, navigation aids  
- **Data Operations**: Copy-to-clipboard, time formatting, CSV export functionality
- **Specialized Selectors**: User, group, and license selection with search and filtering

## Architectural Design Patterns

### 1. Composition Architecture
Components are designed for flexible composition, enabling complex UIs from simple building blocks. Each component focuses on a single responsibility while providing clear interfaces for integration.

**Benefits**:
- Promotes code reuse and maintainability
- Enables flexible layouts without component inheritance
- Supports progressive enhancement of functionality

### 2. Render Props and Children Pattern
Components support custom rendering through render props and children patterns, allowing for flexible customization without component modification.

**Benefits**:
- Maintains component reusability while supporting customization
- Enables complex data presentation patterns
- Supports progressive disclosure of information

### 3. Hook-Based Architecture
Components integrate with custom hooks for clean separation of logic and presentation, following React best practices for state management and side effects.

**Benefits**:
- Separates business logic from presentation
- Enables logic reuse across components
- Simplifies testing and maintenance

## Component Interface Patterns

### Standardized Prop Conventions

The component library follows consistent prop naming and typing conventions across all components:

**Base Component Props**:
- Consistent naming for common props (title, loading, error, children)
- Material-UI sx prop support for styling customization
- Predictable prop defaults and optional vs required designations

**API Integration Props**:
- Standardized API configuration object structure
- Consistent query key patterns for caching
- Uniform data loading and error state handling

**Form Component Props**:
- React Hook Form integration patterns
- Consistent validation prop structure  
- Standardized field naming and labeling conventions

### Error Boundaries and Fallbacks

Components implement graceful degradation with:
- Loading state displays using Material-UI Skeleton components
- Error boundaries with meaningful error messages
- Fallback rendering for missing data scenarios

## Performance Architecture

### Component Optimization Strategies

The component library implements several performance optimization patterns:

**Memoization Strategy**:
- Strategic use of React.memo for expensive components
- Custom comparison functions for complex prop objects
- Memoized action definitions and computed values

**Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**:
- Heavy visualization components loaded on demand
- Suspense boundaries with appropriate loading states
- Progressive component loading for large applications

**Data Management**:
- Virtualization for large dataset components  
- Pagination strategies for table and list components
- Efficient query key management for cache optimization

## System Integration Patterns

### API Integration Architecture

Components follow consistent patterns for API integration:

**Data Fetching Strategy**:
- React Query integration for caching and state management
- Standardized API configuration object patterns
- Consistent error handling and loading state management

**Multi-Tenant Context**:
- Automatic tenant context injection
- Tenant-aware API request patterns
- Consistent tenant filtering and scoping

**Cache Management**:
- Predictable query key patterns for cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Background refetching strategies for data freshness

## Architectural Best Practices

### Design Guidelines

**Component Design**:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each component serves a focused purpose
- Composition over inheritance for flexibility and reusability
- Consistent prop interfaces across component categories
- Material-UI v6+ compliance for theming and responsive design

**Integration Standards**:
- React Query for all data fetching and caching
- React Hook Form for form state management
- Consistent error handling and loading state patterns
- Tenant-aware operations throughout the component library

**Performance Guidelines**:
- Strategic memoization for expensive rendering operations
- Code splitting for heavy components and visualization libraries
- Efficient re-rendering patterns with proper dependency management
- Optimized query key patterns for cache management

### Development Workflow

**Component Development**:
- Start with the detailed [component documentation](../components/README.md) for implementation specifics
- Follow established patterns for new component development
- Maintain consistency with existing component interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallback UI

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for component logic and prop validation
- Integration tests for API interactions and form workflows
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Performance testing for large dataset components
