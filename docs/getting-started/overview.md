# CIPP Project Overview

Welcome to CIPP! This document introduces you to the project and helps you understand what it is, how it works, and how you can contribute.

## What is CIPP?

**CIPP (CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal)** is a powerful, open-source Microsoft 365 partner management platform that simplifies the complexity of managing multiple Microsoft 365 tenants from a single, unified interface.

### The Problem CIPP Solves

Microsoft 365 partners and MSPs face significant challenges:
- **Tenant fragmentation**: Managing dozens or hundreds of separate Microsoft 365 tenants
- **Repetitive tasks**: Performing the same administrative actions across multiple environments
- **Inconsistent configurations**: Ensuring security and compliance standards across all tenants
- **Limited visibility**: Getting consolidated reports and insights across the entire partner ecosystem

### The CIPP Solution

CIPP provides a centralized platform that enables:
- **Unified management**: Single dashboard for all your Microsoft 365 tenants
- **Automation**: Standardize configurations and automate routine tasks
- **Monitoring**: Real-time insights into security, compliance, and performance
- **Efficiency**: Reduce administrative overhead and human error

## Who Uses CIPP?

- **Microsoft 365 Partners**: Organizations managing multiple customer tenants
- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: Companies providing IT services to multiple clients
- **IT Administrators**: Teams responsible for large-scale Microsoft 365 deployments
- **Security Teams**: Organizations focused on maintaining consistent security posture

## How CIPP Works

CIPP consists of two main components working together:

### 1. **CIPP Frontend** (This Repository)
- **Modern web application** built with Next.js and React
- **User interface** for managing tenants, users, and configurations
- **Dashboard and reporting** for monitoring and analytics
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile devices

### 2. **CIPP-API Backend** (Separate Repository)
- **PowerShell-based API** running on Azure Functions
- **Microsoft Graph integration** for interacting with Microsoft 365 services
- **Automation engine** for executing tasks across multiple tenants
- **Data storage** and caching for performance

### Key Features

- **Multi-tenant management**: Switch between and manage multiple Microsoft 365 tenants
- **User and group administration**: Create, modify, and manage users and groups across tenants
- **Security monitoring**: Track security alerts, compliance status, and policy violations
- **Automated standards**: Apply and maintain consistent security and configuration standards
- **Reporting and analytics**: Generate reports on usage, security, and compliance
- **Extension system**: Add custom functionality through extensions

## Technology Overview

CIPP uses established technologies that provide reliability and maintainability:

### Frontend Technologies
- **Next.js**: React framework providing routing, optimization, and deployment features
- **React 19**: Modern component-based UI library
- **Material-UI**: Professional component library with consistent design
- **TanStack Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching
- **Redux Toolkit**: Predictable state management

### Integration and APIs
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Direct integration with Microsoft 365 services
- **Azure Active Directory**: Authentication and authorization
- **PowerShell API**: Backend services for automation and management

## Project Structure Overview

CIPP follows a well-organized structure that makes it easy to find and understand different parts of the application:

```

├── public/             # Static assets (images, icons)
└── deployment/         # Deployment configuration
```

### Key Component Categories

CIPP organizes its components into logical categories:

- **CippTable**: Data tables for listing and managing resources (users, groups, etc.)
- **CippCards**: Dashboard cards for displaying metrics and information
- **CippFormPages**: Form components for creating and editing data
- **CippWizard**: Multi-step workflows for complex operations
- **CippComponents**: General utility components used throughout the app
